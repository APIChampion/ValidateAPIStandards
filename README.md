# ValidateAPIStandards



This repo provides a list of tests in Mocha, Chai and Supertest that validate API Standards based on standards used at my company and best practices around the internet such as https://github.com/WhiteHouse/api-standards, https://stripe.com/docs/api/php and https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/ to name a few. These standards have helped me provide governance for APIs within my organization. I acknowledge that these standards like everything else change but this is a great starting point. 

I built this repo as method to validate the standards that I created internally. I created a set of tests that are provided to the engineers within my oranizations. I created these tests because the engineers do not read documentation no matter how cool it looks are how long it took to build. I understand I do not read documenation as carefully as I should either. In fact studies have confirmed that most engineers and people in general do not read documenation so why try to force people to do something. These tests validates standards, including error codes, responses and some data elements. I will provide a list of issues which will be cool enhancements that I will be adding over the next 6 months.
